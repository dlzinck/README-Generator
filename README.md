# README_Generator

I have created a dynamic README generator for users to help speed along the process. By answering the questions given to you a description, table of contents, installation, usage, license, contributing, tests, and questions will be placed into the new dynamic README file. 

This is an assignment given to me by the UA full-stack bootcamp that contained some starter code.
